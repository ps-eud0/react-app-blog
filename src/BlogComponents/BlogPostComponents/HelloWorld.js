            <p>It all started with a simple piece of code: <b>print("Hello, World!")</b>. That iconic line, a rite of passage for every developer, marked the beginning of a journey filled with late-night coding sessions, endless debugging, and small victories that felt monumental. But, like many of us in tech, I had always put off documenting the experiences and lessons learned along the way. Time was consumed by new projects, learning new frameworks, and solving the next big problem.</p>
            <p>However, there was always a lingering thought in the back of my mind: sharing this journey could be just as fulfilling as living it. After all, isn’t that what we developers do best? We build, we solve, and we share—be it in the form of open-source contributions, tutorials, or even snippets of code. And so, this blog was born out of a desire to finally give shape to those stories, ideas, and reflections that have accumulated over the years.</p>
            <p>This is not just another tech blog. It's a collection of moments—big and small—that shaped my path as a developer. From the thrill of writing my first “Hello, World!” to the challenges of scaling an app, this blog will be a space where code meets reflection, where technology intertwines with experience. It’s a place where the backstory of every project matters as much as the code itself.</p>
            <p>So here it is, the long overdue "Hello, World!"—the beginning of something that, like all great code, will evolve, iterate, and hopefully inspire others along the way. Welcome to the journey.</p>
